Tu ću pisat detaljan scenarij za igricu jer ako čekan druge da to naprave; ne bude nikad drugo


## QUEST 1 - Lost and confused
### **PHASE 1 – DETECTION AND TRACKING**

**\[Quest Start Triggered – "Lost & Confused"]**

**Thomas (walkie-talkie):**
"Okay, listen. We’ve got a situation. Again."
"Some clueless tourist from room 212 is wandering around talking to himself."
"I just saw him on camera near the kitchen — looked like he was trying to open a freezer with a screwdriver."
"We don’t *have* an ice cream machine. You need to find him before he breaks something. Or himself."

**\[HUD objective appears: "Find the lost tourist before it’s too late"]**
**\[Tourist’s health bar appears – slowly ticking down]**

**Thomas:**
"He was last seen near the kitchen. I think he knocked over a pan — sounded like a war zone."
"I’ll ping you if anything else comes through."

---

**Ambient HUD text updates (randomized):**

* "Something fell in the hallway in front of room 17."
* "Sounds like he’s screaming from the laundry room."
* "Someone just broke a plate in the kitchen."
* "A fire alarm blinked near the lounge."
* "There’s spilled soda by the vending machines."

**Thomas (if player goes the wrong way):**

* "Nope. Not that way."
* "You're losing him. Come on."
* "Try listening for the noise — not your gut."

**Thomas (as health drops):**

* "He's gonna hurt himself at this rate."
* "Get to him already. Please."
* "If he slips on juice one more time, I’m out."

---

### **PHASE 2 – CHASE & INTERCEPTION**

**Thomas (walkie-talkie):**
"He's sprinting now. Left a whole trail of destruction behind him."
"Broken plates, open doors, knocked-over statue. You’re getting close."

**Ambient cues (visual + sound):**

* Loud crashing sound nearby
* Shouting or mumbling: "Where’s the damn ice cream?"
* Open pantry door swinging
* Soda can rolling across the hallway

**Thomas (urgency increasing):**
"If you don’t catch him now, I’m quitting. Full stop."

---

### **PHASE 3 – STOPPING THE IDIOT**

**\[Player reaches the tourist – he's standing at the edge of a balcony, dangerously close to falling]**

**Tourist (intro line):**
"They told me it was here… the machine… the ice cream machine! But every hallway’s a lie, and every door just leads to more doors!"

**Thomas (walkie-talkie):**
"If you don’t catch him now, I’m quitting. Full stop."

---

**First dialogue choices (player):**

1. "Hey, don’t jump. The people who love you would be heartbroken."
2. "There’s still so much life ahead of you — so many successes waiting for you."
3. "Dinner’s free for those who stay alive."
4. \[Use item: Throw pillow] (if available)

---

#### **Option 1: "Hey, don’t jump..."**

**Tourist:**
"What? I... I don’t even know if anyone knows I’m here. I didn’t even tell my mom I left."

**Follow-up choices:**

1. "You matter more than you think." (low success chance)
2. "Come down and we’ll figure it out together." (medium success chance)
3. "Dinner’s free for those who stay alive." (guaranteed success)

---

#### **Option 2: "There’s still so much life ahead..."**

**Tourist:**
"Success? I can’t even find a vending machine in this cursed place!"

**Follow-up choices:**

1. "This place is weird, but you’re not alone." (medium success chance)
2. "Step back, I’ll find that ice cream for you myself." (low success chance)
3. "Dinner’s free for those who stay alive." (guaranteed success)

---

#### **Option 3: "Dinner’s free for those who stay alive."**

**Tourist:**
"...Free dinner? Like… dessert too?"
"...Okay. Yeah. I’m listening."

---

### **SUCCESS OUTCOME**

**\[Player successfully intervenes. Health bar disappears. Quest completes.]**

**Thomas (walkie-talkie):**
"Thank GOD. I was two seconds from walking out. Get him to room 212 and lock the damn door."

**Tourist (while walking back):**
"Hey… uh… I saw something earlier. Something weird. You ever seen a guy in a rabbit suit crawling through the vents?"

**\[Reward: +XYZ Sanity]**
**\[Hint unlocked: "The tourist might have seen something — something he wasn’t supposed to."]**

---

### **FAILURE OUTCOME**

**\[Health bar reaches zero or player chooses badly. Tourist falls.]**

**Tourist:**
"No one listens... no one ever listens."
**\[Tourist slips and falls off balcony]**

**Thomas (walkie-talkie):**
"You had one job... I quit."

**\[Quest Failed]**

---

### **OPTIONAL ACTION – THROW PILLOW**

**\[Player uses item to interrupt tourist’s movement]**

**Tourist:**
"Wha—??" (stumbles, falls on his butt)
"Did you just throw a pillow at me?"

**Follow-up choices after throw:**

1. "Yes. Because I care." (medium success chance)
2. "It’s soft. Like life, if you don’t fall off balconies." (high success chance if followed by next line)
3. "Dinner’s free for those who stay alive." (guaranteed success)
