Tu ću pisat detaljan scenarij za igricu jer ako čekan druge da to naprave; ne bude nikad drugo


## QUEST 1 - Lost and confused
### **PHASE 1 – DETECTION AND TRACKING**

**\[Quest Start Triggered – "Lost & Confused"]**

**Thomas (walkie-talkie):**
"Okay, listen. We’ve got a situation. Again."
"Some clueless tourist from room 212 is wandering around talking to himself."
"I just saw him on camera near the kitchen — looked like he was trying to open a freezer with a screwdriver."
"We don’t *have* an ice cream machine. You need to find him before he breaks something. Or himself."

**\[HUD objective appears: "Find the lost tourist before it’s too late"]**
**\[Tourist’s health bar appears – slowly ticking down]**

**Thomas:**
"He was last seen near the kitchen. I think he knocked over a pan — sounded like a war zone."
"I’ll ping you if anything else comes through."

---

**Ambient HUD text updates (randomized):**

* "Something fell in the hallway in front of room 17."
* "Sounds like he’s screaming from the laundry room."
* "Someone just broke a plate in the kitchen."
* "A fire alarm blinked near the lounge."
* "There’s spilled soda by the vending machines."

**Thomas (if player goes the wrong way):**

* "Nope. Not that way."
* "You're losing him. Come on."
* "Try listening for the noise — not your gut."

**Thomas (as health drops):**

* "He's gonna hurt himself at this rate."
* "Get to him already. Please."
* "If he slips on juice one more time, I’m out."

---

### **PHASE 2 – CHASE & INTERCEPTION**

**Thomas (walkie-talkie):**
"He's sprinting now. Left a whole trail of destruction behind him."
"Broken plates, open doors, knocked-over statue. You’re getting close."

**Ambient cues (visual + sound):**

* Loud crashing sound nearby
* Shouting or mumbling: "Where’s the damn ice cream?"
* Open pantry door swinging
* Soda can rolling across the hallway

**Thomas (urgency increasing):**
"If you don’t catch him now, I’m quitting. Full stop."

---

### **PHASE 3 – STOPPING THE IDIOT**

**\[Player reaches the tourist – he's standing at the edge of a balcony, dangerously close to falling]**

**Tourist (intro line):**
"They told me it was here… the machine… the ice cream machine! But every hallway’s a lie, and every door just leads to more doors!"

**Thomas (walkie-talkie):**
"If you don’t catch him now, I’m quitting. Full stop."

---

**First dialogue choices (player):**

1. "Hey, don’t jump. The people who love you would be heartbroken."
2. "There’s still so much life ahead of you — so many successes waiting for you."
3. "Dinner’s free for those who stay alive."
4. \[Use item: Throw pillow] (if available)

---

#### **Option 1: "Hey, don’t jump..."**

**Tourist:**
"What? I... I don’t even know if anyone knows I’m here. I didn’t even tell my mom I left."

**Follow-up choices:**

1. "You matter more than you think." (low success chance)
2. "Come down and we’ll figure it out together." (medium success chance)
3. "Dinner’s free for those who stay alive." (guaranteed success)

---

#### **Option 2: "There’s still so much life ahead..."**

**Tourist:**
"Success? I can’t even find a vending machine in this cursed place!"

**Follow-up choices:**

1. "This place is weird, but you’re not alone." (medium success chance)
2. "Step back, I’ll find that ice cream for you myself." (low success chance)
3. "Dinner’s free for those who stay alive." (guaranteed success)

---

#### **Option 3: "Dinner’s free for those who stay alive."**

**Tourist:**
"...Free dinner? Like… dessert too?"
"...Okay. Yeah. I’m listening."

---

### **SUCCESS OUTCOME**

**\[Player successfully intervenes. Health bar disappears. Quest completes.]**

**Thomas (walkie-talkie):**
"Thank GOD. I was two seconds from walking out. Get him to room 212 and lock the damn door."

**Tourist (while walking back):**
"Hey… uh… I saw something earlier. Something weird. You ever seen a guy in a rabbit suit crawling through the vents?"

**\[Reward: +XYZ Sanity]**
**\[Hint unlocked: "The tourist might have seen something — something he wasn’t supposed to."]**

---

### **FAILURE OUTCOME**

**\[Health bar reaches zero or player chooses badly. Tourist falls.]**

**Tourist:**
"No one listens... no one ever listens."
**\[Tourist slips and falls off balcony]**

**Thomas (walkie-talkie):**
"You had one job... I quit."

**\[Quest Failed]**

---

### **OPTIONAL ACTION – THROW PILLOW**

**\[Player uses item to interrupt tourist’s movement]**

**Tourist:**
"Wha—??" (stumbles, falls on his butt)
"Did you just throw a pillow at me?"

**Follow-up choices after throw:**

1. "Yes. Because I care." (medium success chance)
2. "It’s soft. Like life, if you don’t fall off balconies." (high success chance if followed by next line)
3. "Dinner’s free for those who stay alive." (guaranteed success)


Here is the **complete English dialogue tree** for the quest **"Night Drip" (Noćna kapljica)**, structured chronologically with all branches and player choices included. It reflects the mysterious, looping atmosphere of the quest and supports replayability.

---

## **"Night Drip" – Dialogue Tree (English)**

**\[Quest Begins – Player enters dimly lit bar, jukebox hums softly in the background]**

**Joža (leaning over the counter, swaying slightly):**
"Come on, be a good sport and bring me that bottle. You know which one I mean."
**\[Pause – smirks vaguely]**
"Not the one that sings. The one that smells like the end of summer."

**\[Player heads into storage – finds 3 bottles, each unlabeled and unfamiliar. Must choose one.]**

---

## **Player Brings a Bottle to Joža**

**Joža (accepts it, inspecting):**
"Hah. Bold choice."
**(or)**
"...Well, well. That’s a dangerous one."

**\[Joža pours a drink for himself, takes a sip, and reacts according to bottle contents:]**

---

### **1. NEUTRAL OUTCOME – Gemišt (white wine + sparkling water)**

**Joža (sighs nostalgically):**
"Aaaaah, this one’s like a lazy Sunday afternoon… quiet, useless, and full of ghosts."

**\[Optional: Player can choose to drink as well]**

> **If Player Drinks:**

**Joža (becomes talkative, but confusing):**
"You know, people always forget the second floor used to be a chapel. That’s why the plumbing hates Wednesdays."
"They sealed the mirror behind the mirror, but not the cracks behind the cracks."
"Ever hear humming in the vents? That’s not the wind, friend."

> **If Player Does NOT Drink:**

**Joža (shrugs):**
"Suit yourself. No taste for memory, eh?"
**\[He continues mumbling cryptic things under his breath while wiping glasses.]**

---

### **2. NEGATIVE OUTCOME – Black Rum**

**Joža (gulps, grimaces):**
"Now *this* is a mistake in a bottle. Just the way I like it."

**\[Environment starts to shift – lighting flickers, camera distorts. Brief hallucinations occur.]**

**Joža (voice echoes unnaturally):**
"You shouldn’t have brought this one."
"Funny thing is… it remembers *you*."
**\[Whispers in the background: unintelligible phrases or names the player recognizes from previous gameplay]**

**\[Optional: Player can drink too]**

> **If Player Drinks:**

**\[Screen warps further. Player control becomes erratic for 2 minutes. Entity flickers in background hallways.]**

**Joža (distorted):**
"You’re not the first one to drink this… and you know what? The last one still hasn’t woken up."

> **If Player Does NOT Drink:**

**Joža:**
"Smart. You might actually make it through the week."
"But then again… maybe you already drank it. Maybe this is the dream."

---

### **3. POSITIVE OUTCOME – Green Shot**

**Joža (grins widely):**
"Oh-ho! You brought *that* one."
"Be careful. It’s just for a short while, you know\... the hotel doesn’t like it when you’re faster than it."

**\[Optional: Player can drink too]**

> **If Player Drinks:**

**\[Screen colors intensify briefly. Movement becomes swift and smooth. +Speed/Reflex boost for 2 minutes]**

**Joža:**
"Run while you can. Doors tend to behave while you're quick. For a while."
"Just don’t let the walls catch up."

> **If Player Does NOT Drink:**

**Joža (disappointed):**
"Wasted gift, that one. Don’t expect a second chance from the bottle."

---

## **General End-of-Interaction Dialogue (random chance, regardless of choice)**

**Joža (leans in, voice low):**
"You’re not the first one to drink this… and you know what? The last one still hasn’t woken up."

**Joža (if in a good mood):**
"Come back tomorrow. Or whenever the jukebox changes its tune."

**Joža (if annoyed):**
"Next time, read the bottle’s silence before you bring it."

---

## **Summary of Player Choices**

1. **Which bottle to bring** → Randomized visual appearance; each corresponds to:

   * Gemišt (neutral/story clues)
   * Black Rum (hallucinations and disorientation)
   * Green Shot (temporary gameplay boost)

2. **Whether to drink or refuse** →

   * Drink: Triggers effect tied to that bottle
   * Refuse: Prevents effect, alters Joža’s attitude and lines

“Where’s That Tray Now?”

---

**Quest Start – Joža greets you, panicking:**

Joža:
"Hurry up, the bar is a mess!"
"In a minute, you need to bring me the tray, you know, the black one with the scratch in the middle — I won’t even carry a glass of water without it!"
"It’s somewhere in the cupboard behind the bar… I hope."

**\[Timer starts – player begins searching cupboards]**

---

**If player finds the correct tray in time:**

Joža (relieved):
"Ahhh, now we can get to work. You're not completely useless."
"Here, take this. Don’t lose it — or do, I don’t care."

\[Player receives mysterious item]

---

**If player fails to find the tray in time:**

Joža (resigned):
"Oh well, we'll serve it on the cutting board again."
"At least we won't be lying to them..."

\[No reward, but the player hears a strange sound from an unopened cupboard]

---

“Serving from Memory”**

---

**Quest Start – Vjeko greets you bluntly:**

Vjeko:
"My assistant left."
"You’re stepping in now."
"The guests don’t like to wait."
"Watch closely. You’ll only see it once."

\[Order appears briefly on the wall — then disappears]

---

**During the task (if player is slow or makes mistakes):**

Vjeko (grumbling):
"That’s not how it looked."
"Focus!"
"You're wasting time."
"Have you ever seen a plate before?"

---

**If player makes multiple mistakes or runs out of time:**

Vjeko (angrily):
"Enough. Get out of my kitchen."
"I’ll finish this before the food dies of boredom."
\[Player is kicked out of the kitchen / may lose sanity]

---

**If player completes all orders correctly:**

Vjeko (nods silently):
"...Hmph."
"You might be useful after all."
\[He opens a hidden passage behind the fridge]

Vjeko (quietly):
"You didn’t see me do this."

\[Player gains access to a secret area or hidden clue]

---
